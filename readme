Hello, Rea here!
There's a few things that you need to know about this repository.

- Don't consider the appearance of Jupyter notebooks based on what you see on GitHub
Because everything that I made, about appearence, was to Visual Code (and it looks beautiful on it, by the way), so probaly, it will be ugly and different if you see in GitHub. 

Here is an example how it looks like in Visual Code (ps: this images are gifs, and the titles are neons and has an animation that I made and few other cool visual things!)

The purpose of having this on GitHub is to make sure I don't lose these files and also to have the versioning capability for them.
Having access on another computer, being able to see a past version, sharing the same file with someone... There are countless reasons that make this a good idea.
