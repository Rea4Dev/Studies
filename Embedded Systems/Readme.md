This is the main folder, the Embedded Systems studies folder. The notebook is in the "Embedded Systems Notebook" file.

This content is in learning order. To use it, you would only need to have knowledge of C language and electrical circuits. I would also strongly recommend using simulation software such as "Proteus" and digital/analogic electronics.

You do not need to have advanced knowledge in any of the topics above, in fact, you could start each of them together with this content. I would recommend just taking a quick look at the programming logic with C, but your approach depends on your choice, just know that a good way if you don't master the concepts above is to study them all from the beginning together with this embedded content.

In any case, this content is in learning order and at the beginning it is understood that you do not understand anything about embedded systems.

This content was made by me, through my studies and from the beginning, so this is the order in which I learned everything. I didn't worry too much about how other people would study this, but rather about how I wanted to learn the content. Still, I strongly believe it would be a good foundation for someone who doesn't know where to start.

The main reason for hosting this content here is to always have version control and its benefits, in addition to creating a secure backup and being able to access it from any other machine (in addition to also having the possibility of sharing this knowledge with anyone else).

The notebook is in the "Embedded Systems Notebook" file. I believe if you have Visual Code on your machine, the Jupyter extension and download this repository, then the notebook will open styled. However, be aware that this is not the "complete styling", as it is originally complete with my other styling done in Visual Code.
By successfully downloading the repository, you would only have Jupyter. Anyway, below is an image illustrating what it actually looks like:

The workbook is where I practiced some concepts. I didn't explain them in depth beyond the title because that would take a lot of time and make me difficult to study, but in any case, these are just practical examples and practical studies on various topics within embedded development, such as "PCB Creation" , "creation of electronic schematics", "simulation of microcontrollers", "creation of codes" and others.

A considerable part of the files in this folder will be the file generated by the "Proteus" software, a CAD software for electrical schematics and simulations. Codes may also be present in this folder.
