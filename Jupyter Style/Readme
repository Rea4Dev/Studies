It's just a file where I've been creating my custom Jupyter style.

My Visual Code was entirely modified and styled by me and for me. Now, Jupyter (which is the jupyter visual code extension) is also styled by me and for me.

The letters have neon animation and go up when you move the mouse over them, colors and styles are set, everything is centered and several other settings. In the background of the Visual Code, a gif of my favorite characters, Bonbon & Chuchu, keeps playing. If you want to see how it looks, go to:
