My Jupyter is completely styled and customized by me and for me. This folder is the configuration of this stylization and also the base of images and gifs that I use in this process.

If you download this entire repository and have Jupyter for VsCode installed (because remember, I use the one integrated with VsCode) it should work as expected.

For the proper experience I have, you also need to insert a background gif that I use (this gif stays in the entire VsCode background). But I will teach you that at another time.
