Below will be topics about it and an image that illustrates what my Jupyter looks like:

- Titles with neon effect, responsive and customizable color.
- Possibility of highlighting with different colors and neon.
- Font styling.
- Various other stylizations and the possibility of quickly creating or modifying something.
